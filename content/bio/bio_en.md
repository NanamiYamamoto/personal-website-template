One of the observation methods in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM),Optimum Bright Field (OBF) method, is a technique that theoretically enables image reconstruction with the maximum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The OBF method can achieve high SNR even under low-dose conditions, making it effective for observing two-dimensional (2D) materials, which are sensitive to electron beams. Since 2D materials are typically observed under low-acceleration conditions, developing an OBF reconstruction method that accounts for chromatic aberration is expected to further enhance the SNR. By applying OBF method considering chromatic aberration to experiments, the aim of this research is to observe various 2D materials.
